2.) Variable is something which store data whereas strings is a data type for a sequence of characters.

3.) The three different data types are:-

     a.)Numeric - numeric data type represent the data which has numeric value. Numeric value can be integer, floating number or even complex numbers.
     
     b.)Sequence Type - sequence is the ordered collection of similar or different data types. Sequences allows to store multiple values in an organized and efficient fashion.
     
     c.)Boolean - Data type with one of the two built-in values, True or False. 

4.)Expressions made up of something, like a number, a string, or an instance of a class. Any value is an expression!
   An expression is an instruction that combines values and operators and always evaluates down to a single value.

5.)A statement is a complete line of code that performs some action, while an expression is any section of the code that evaluates to a value.

8.)variable names in Python can be any length and can consist of uppercase and lowercase letters ( A-Z , a-z ), digits ( 0-9 ), and the underscore character ( _ ). An additional restriction is that, although a variable name can contain digits, the first character of a variable name cannot be a digit.
   Thats why egg is valid variable name but 100 is not.

9.)The int(), float(), and str() functions will evaluate to the integer, floating-point number, and string versions of the value passed to them.

10.) Because we tried to concatnet string with integer. By using type casting (i.e convert int to str), we can solve the error.
